# TRS-80 Model 1 (Rev E) Replica - E1

This project is a reverse-engineered PCB created to document the mainboard of the iconic TRS-80 Model 1 (Revision E) computer. Revision E is the third released version of the mainboard and introduces no functional changes. The only update is the addition of a solder mask on the top side, improving from previous revisions, which only had a solder mask on the bottom.

The entire project is available under the MIT license.

**NOTE:** The PCB has not yet been validated. Once I am able to fully validate the PCB by producing a board and thoroughly testing it, I will make the Gerber files available. Additionally, I will have some PCBs available in my [store](https://shop.retrostack.org).
